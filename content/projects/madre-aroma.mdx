**Full-stack, pragmatic, and production-ready.**  
Madre Aroma is an appointment management and user scheduling platform built with **Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL** on the backend and **React + Vite** on the frontend.  
The app enables user registration, authentication, and session handling through **JWT**, and supports CRUD operations for appointments with **role-based access control**. The RESTful API is deployed on **Railway** with a PostgreSQL cloud database, and the frontend is hosted on **Vercel**.

---

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Authentication & Sessions** — JWT-based auth with protected routes and session handling.  
- **Role-Based Access Control** — different capabilities per role (e.g., admin vs. user).  
- **Appointments CRUD** — create, update, list, and cancel with validations.  
- **Responsive UI** — clean, mobile-friendly interface for booking and management.  
- **Integrated REST API** — Express controllers + TypeORM entities + PostgreSQL.  
- **Environment Configuration** — `.env` for secure keys and environment-specific settings.

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeORM, PostgreSQL  
**Frontend:** React, Vite, CSS Modules  
**Auth:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
**Tooling:** Axios (HTTP), Formik (forms + validation), CORS  
**Deployment:** Railway (API + DB), Vercel (Frontend)
